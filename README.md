ðŸš€ Overview

Accurate segmentation of brain tumors from MRI scans is essential for diagnosis, treatment planning, and follow-up in neuro-oncology.
This project implements a U-Net convolutional neural network, trained on public MRI datasets (e.g., BRATS) and fine-tuned using clinical MRI data from the Oncology and Hematology Center of the Mohammed VI University Hospital in Marrakech.

An interactive Streamlit application called NeuroSeg is provided, enabling real-time testing and visualization of the modelâ€™s segmentation results.
